## Project Description: 
_This project aims to design and implement a digital FM receiver capable of receiving analog FM radio signals and converting them into digital data. The project will include:_

### Hardware:

**Schematic and PCB Design:** A carefully designed schematic and PCB will be created to ensure optimal performance and reliability of the FM receiver circuit. </br>
**Arduino R4 Microcontroller**: This powerful 32-bit microcontroller will be used to process the digital output and interface with the PC. </br>
**Antenna:** An efficient antenna will be designed to capture FM signals effectively. </br>

### Software:
**Firmware:** The Arduino R4 will be programmed to:
- Receive FM signals from the antenna </br>
- Demodulate the signals to extract audio data </br>
- Convert the audio data into digital format </br>
- Transmit the digital data to the PC via a serial communication protocol </br>
**PC Application:**
- C++: A C++ application will be developed to process the received digital data, potentially for further analysis or storage. </br>
- C#: A C# application will be created to provide a user-friendly interface for controlling the receiver and visualizing the received data. </br> 

**Key Features:**
- **High-Quality Audio Reception:** The receiver will be optimized for clear and accurate audio reproduction. </br>
- **Reliable Data Transmission:** The serial communication between the Arduino and PC will ensure robust data transfer. </br>
- **Flexible Software Interface:** The C++ and C# applications will offer versatility for different use cases. </br>
- **Customizable Hardware:** The modular design will allow for easy customization and experimentation. </br>
